The CodeWarrior project here builds a CFM version of the sample app and the resulting
app can be run on Mac OS 8/9 and X. The functionality that is only available on Mac OS
X v.10.1 and later is conditionally available.

At the moment, CodeWarrior 7.0 does not handle NIB files gracefully. For this 
reason, the project does not contain anything in the Resources section so 
the contents of the English.lproj folder was manually copied to the created 
application bundle. In addition, CodeWarrior does not create the Info.plist file so the
version of that file was copied manually into the Contents directory of application
bundle.
